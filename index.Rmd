# Plagiarism

* I am trying to balance two competing perspectives:
  1. Collaboration is good
  2. Collaboration is cheating
* In-class collaboration is good **to a point**.
* You are always expected to write and submit your **own work**.
* Asking for help is ok (after 15 minute rule), 
* Blindly copy from your peers (or published work) is not.

# Rethinking econometrics

## Rethinking econometrics

 - Statistics is the science of uncertainty and variation.
 - Time series financial econometrics is the application of statistics to dynamic problems in finance.
 - Ethically, statistical models should be thought of as engineered robots.

---
class: middle

## Rethinking econometrics
  - Statistic courses and books, including this one, resemble horoscopes
    - In order to remain plausibly correct, they must remain tremendously vague
    - There are strong incentives for statisticians to exaggerate the power of their advice.
  - Scientific discovery is not an additive process and statistical inference is only as critical as every other part of research.

## Rethinking econometrics

\href{http://iase-web.org/documents/papers/icots2/Speed.pdf}{\bf"Statistics is no closer to mathematics than cooking is to chemistry"- Terry Speed 1986}

\bigskip

  - In statistics context is king, and in econometrics we have to look to the context of the research questions before applying techniques.
  - Blind application of techniques without understanding is dangerous and unethical.

## Rethinking econometric models
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{robot}

\fontsize{12}{14}\sf

 - Modestly, models can be thought of as **engineer statistical robots**. 
 - Engineered via a set of (usually unrealistic) assumptions.
 - Animated by "truth".
 - Hopefully powerful.
 - Blind to the creator's intent.
 - Easy to misuse.
 - Not even false: They are as false as a hammer!

\begin{verse}[\versewidth]
\Fontvi
Masons, when they start upon a building, \\
Are careful to test out the scaffolding; \\~\\

Make sure that planks won’t slip at busy points, \\
Secure all ladders, tighten bolted joints.\\~\\

And yet all this comes down when the job’s done \\
Showing off walls of sure and solid stone.\\~\\

So if, my dear, there sometimes seem to be \\
Old bridges breaking between you and me \\~\\

Never fear. We may let the scaffolds fall \\ 
Confident that we have built our wall.

## Ethical econometrics

  - Ethical econometrics is having enough confidence and knowledge in statistics to understand its limitations.
  - This course provides an *ethical* scaffold, to construct *statistical* models.
  - This course will force you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
  
## Ethical econometrics  

  - The reason for all the algorithmic fuss is to ensure that you understand enough of the details to make sensible choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.
  - At first we will take things slow but move on to use more automation.

## Rethinking: Staring into the abyss. 

* Econometric models can be complicated monsters. 
* But as models become more monstrous, so too does the code needed to compute predictions and display them. **With power comes hardship.** 
* It’s better to see the guts of the machine than to live in awe or fear of it.  
* Software can be and often is written to hide all the monstrosity from us. 
* But this doesn’t make it go away. 
* Instead, it just makes the models forever mysterious. 
* For some users, mystery translates into awe. 
* For others, it translates into skepticism. 
* Neither condition is necessary, as long as we’re willing to learn the structure of the models we are using.
* And if you aren’t willing to learn the structure of the models, then don’t do your own statistics. 
* Instead, collaborate with or hire a statistician.

---
class: middle

## Model checking

* Every model is a merger of **sense** and **nonsense**
* When we understand a model, we find its sense and control its nonsense.
* Complex models should not be view with awe but with **informed** suspicion.
* Intellectual discipline provides the base to be *informed* 
      * comes with breaking down the model into its components and checking its validity.

## Ethical econometrics with R

  - An industry standard for modern statistical analysis.
  - Creates reusable, transparent, and interpretable code.
  - Ethical econometrics is about creating reproducible research.
  - The goal of this course is to teach basic computational skills for sensible FTS analysis.
  - You will not become an expert programmer!

# Uncertainty in econometrics

## Uncertainty in econometrics
  - Uncertainty is the overarching tenent of statistics.
  - Uncertainty is applied using a probability theory.
  - Probability theory is just a calculus for counting; and thus can be used to represent plausibility of things like model parameters.
  - Unlike most other branches of mathematics, statistics has no unifying theory of probability.
  - The two popular approaches to probability are bayesian and frequentist.

---
class: middle
  
## Bayesian inference
  - The term *bayesian* has many uses in statistics but mainly as a way of interpreting probability.
  - In modest terms, Bayesian inference is no more than counting the number of ways things can happen, according to our assumptions.
  - More plausible things can happen more ways.
  
## Bayesian inference  
  - Once assumptions are defined, Bayesian inference forces a purely logical way of processing that information to produce inference.
  - Count all the ways data can happen, according to assumptions
  - Assumptions with more ways that are consistent with the data are more plausible.
  - In this way all parts of the model building process can exhibit uncertainty.

---
class: middle
  
## Frequentist inference
  - Frequentist probability is a special case of Bayesian probability.
  - It defines probability by connection to countable events and their frequencies in very large samples.
  - The leads to frequentist uncertainty being premised on imaginery resampling of data.
  - A fantasy of repeating the measurement many many times, to collect a list of values which will have some pattern to it.
  
## Frequentist inference  
  - This means that parameters and models cannot have probability distributions, only measurement (data).
  - The distribution of these measurement is called a **SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION**.
  - In practice resampling is never done, and in general it doesn't even make sense. 
  
---
class: middle

## Bayesian Versus frequentist

\small 

  - The frequentist philosophical approach (sometime referred to as *classical*) is convention in econometrics.
    - This is probably more to do with scientists' desire for results via *bright line* hypothesis testing than rigorous analysis.
  - It involves postulating a theory then setting up a model and collecting data to test this model.
  - Based on the results of the model, the theory is supported or refuted.
  - A common approach is null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) using p-values.

---
class: middle
  
## Bayesian versus frequentist

  - In Bayesian inference the theory and model are developed together.
    - Parameters, models and measurement have probability distributions.
  - An assessment of existing knowledge is formulated into *prior* probabilities.
  - Data are combined with *priors* to form and model in a strictly logical way to produce updated probabilities known as *posteriors*.
  - Bayesian inference is computationally intensive, which used to be a barrier to application.

---
class: middle
  
## Bayesian Versus frequentist

  - Some *classical* researcher find Bayesian approach controversial.
  - Strong priors can be hard to dominate with data, so researchers can pick whatever results they want!
  - In modern statistics this controversy is largely redundant.

---
class: middle

## Rethinking econometrics 
  - In ethical econometrics, each approach can arguable have fantastical assumptions:
    1. What does the data look like under resampling?
    2. Using probability to describe prior beliefs or knowledge.
  - Rather like robots, statistical models are neither true or false, rather constructs engineered for some purpose.
  - Importantly, context is everything in statistics, and a *ethical econometrician* should use all avaliable tools in their statistical engineering arsenal.

## Rethinking econometrics: \small to explain, predict or describe

\fontsize{12}{14}\sf

  - It is **wrongly** assumed that high explanatory = high predictive power. 
  - Explanatory models apply statistics to data to test **casual** hypothesis of theoretical constructs.
  - Prediction models apply statistics or data mining algorithms to data to predict future observations.
  - The type of model uncertainty is different for each choice.
  - Explaining minimises *bias*, while prediction minimises *bias + variance* occasionally sacrificing theoretical accuracy for empirical precision.

## Building a model

  * How to use probability to do typical statistical modeling?
  1. Design the model (data story)
    * Formulated using theory from previous studies
  2. Condition on the data (update or estimate model)
  3. Evaluate the model (critique)
  * **And Repeat Until Satisified**

## Reading finance papers (the context)

  - You data story comes from reading research papers
  
### Research project tips
  
  - Does it develop a new model?
  - Is it an existing technique with a new application?
  - Is it a data mining excercise?
  - Is the data of *good quality* ? Reliable, sample size etc.

class: middle

## Reading finance papers

### Research project tips

  - Have model assumptions been validly checked and critiqued?
  - Are results interpreted sensibly or exaggerated?
  - Do results actually address the questions posed?
  - Have conclusions been drawn appropriate or overstated?

## Model comparison

  - Instead of falsifying a null model, compare meaningful models.
  - Basic problems
    - Overfitting or Data Snooping
    - Causal inference
  - Ockham's razor is silly
  - Information theory is less silly
    - AIC, cross-validation
  - Must distinguish prediction from inference

## Applying financial time series econometrics

  - Financial time series econometrics is concerned with theory and practice of asset valuation over time
  - It has similarity to other time series analysis but has some added uncertainty.
  - FTS analysis must deal with the ever-changing business and economic enviroment and the fact that volatility is not directly observed.
